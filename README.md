### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is John Noonan (he/him). 

I use computers to tell stories and create unique experiences. I do this through my own art and by creating tools and developing software that can better facilitate meaningful creation for others. I use my knowledge of media creation to allow artists to make the best work they can and contribute to amazing experiences by creating tools, applications, research, art, and interactive media. 

Currently I am a creative technologist at [HUSH Studios](https://heyhush.com/) working on some super cool projects. You can [find my portfolio here](https://johnenoonan.github.io/) and see some of the work I've been up to. Thanks!
