### Hi there 👋
My name is John Noonan (he/him). 

I use computers to tell stories and create unique experiences. I do this through my own art and by creating tools and developing software that can better facilitate meaningful creation for others.

My work is driven by the desire to unlock new possibilities and inspire creative minds. Whether it's developing cutting-edge software or crafting immersive narratives, I am dedicated to fostering a rich environment where the fusion of technology and artistry flourishes.

Some of the things I've enjoyed working on range from making data driven animations for the worlds largest mobility company, predicting render times for feature animated films using machine learning, to making a NYC street tree dating app (my favorite street trees are dogwoods by the way 🐕🌳).

Currently I am a creative technologist at [HUSH](https://heyhush.com/) working on some super cool projects. You can [find my portfolio here](https://johnenoonan.github.io/) and see some of the work I've been up to. Thanks!
